# GloVe-win
Stanford GloVe(https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) tools built for windows compiled with visual studio 2015 on Windows 10 x64.

You could just download a release at https://github.com/anoidgit/GloVe-win/releases and run it on Windows as the same way on linux.

If you have a large mount of parameters to train(a large number of words or high dimension of embeddings) which means you will need a large amount of memory to use, you'd better use the 64-bit version if the 32-bit version can not work, but for most of the time, 32-bit version is just enough to work.
